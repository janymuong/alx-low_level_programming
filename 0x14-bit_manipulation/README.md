## Bit Manipulation

Variables differ in storage and this affects how different variables can be used in different computations.
Knowledge of ```bit fields```, ```bit manipulation``` and ```bitwise operations``` would be particularly useful in promoting programming efficiency with respect to utilizing the correct data types and ```memory``` usage.
This directory also indirectly and partly covers bit models.

> **Note**: this is useful as well in debugging and logging, compression/decompression routines, graphics programming etc.
