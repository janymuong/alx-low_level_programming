# Search Algorithms

This project focuses on implementing various search algorithms in the `C` programming language. The search algorithms are designed to find specific elements within a given dataset/problem space efficiently. Search algorithms are designed to solve **search** problems with respect to how the data structures they're used in are implemented eg hashing, linear, and binary search.


## Time Complexity

The search algorithms have different time complexities, which are denoted using `Big O notation` which denote maximum theoretical run time and computational complexity. In this project, we'll look at `space complexity` as well.
